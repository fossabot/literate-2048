# threes-cljs

An attempt to implement [threes](http://asherv.com/threes/) in ClojureScript using [gnandretta/literate-2048](http://github.com/gnandretta/literate-2048) as a starting point.


## Usage

This is a work in progress. Install [Leiningen](http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) and run `lein cljsbuild auto dev` to automatically rebuild the game when the source changes. Open `index.dev.html` in your favorite browser.
