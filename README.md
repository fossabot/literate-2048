# literate-2048

Repo for [Literate-ish 2048 in ClojureScript](https://medium.com/@gnandretta/literate-ish-2048-in-clojurescript-9c8872c96d2).


## Usage

Install [Leiningen](http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) and run
`lein cljsbuild once dev` to build the game. You can play by opening
`index.dev.html` in your favorite browser (I've only played it on chrome and
firefox). If you want to play with the code instead  run
`lein cljsbuild auto dev` to automatically rebuild the game when the source
changes.
